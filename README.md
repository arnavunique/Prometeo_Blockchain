**To design a decentralized digital currency system for the institute, we have taken the following steps:** <br />
<br />
1. Create a blockchain network using a consensus algorithm such as Proof of Work or Proof of Stake.<br />
2. Develop smart contracts for the token creation and management. The admin should have the ability to add tokens to a particular user's wallet, recognizing their work.<br />
3. Develop a wallet for each user that contains private and public keys. Use the hash of the public key as the address of each user's wallet.<br />
4. Create a list of rewards that can be redeemed by students using their tokens. Administrators should be able to create and manage this list.<br />
5. Allow students to transfer tokens between each other. Impose a 25% tax on transfers between different batches, with the tokens expiring in 4 years. No tax should be applied on transfers within the same batch.<br />
6. Include the hash of each transaction in the body of each block.<br />
7. Develop a system for issuing ID cards for each student that will not be subject to changes. The ID card can be stored on-chain or off-chain.<br />
8. Create a web application that interacts with the blockchain network and allows users to manage their wallets and transactions.<br />
